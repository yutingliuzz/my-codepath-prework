<li>My Design Idea</li>
As a passionate runner, I realized during my first marathon prepartion that most running apps primarily focus on tracking performance but lack a sense of community. Preparing for a marathon can often feel isolating, with no one to share thoughts, concerns, or tips with. 

To address this, I want to create an app designed for runners, especially those preparing for marathons. The app will foster a supportive and close-knit community where users can:
<li>Share preparation plans and daily training schedules</li>
<li>Discuss tips, challenges, and experiences related to marathons</li>
<li>Connect with like-minded runners</li>

Additionally, the app will feature personalized training notes, allowing users to reflect on each training session by documenting their feelings, insights, and areas for improvement. My goal is to provide not just a tool, but a space for runners to motivate and uplift each other in their journey.

## Notes

Initially, making connections from the UI to logic is confusing, but the tutorial helps a lot.
